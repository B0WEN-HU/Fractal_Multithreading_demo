# Fractal_Multithreading_demo
This is a demo of the C++11 multithreading feature.

The program will visualize the fractal shapes of Mandelbrot set.


Fractal_s.cpp is a singlethreaded program.
Fractal_MT_block.cpp is a multithreaded program divided the Mandelbrot set in blocks.
Fractal_MT_inter.cpp is a multithreaded program divided the Mandelbrot set intervally.
Mandelbrot12k.bmp is the picture of visualization.
